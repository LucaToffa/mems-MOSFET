== Simulated transfer and output characteristics
The simulated transfer and output characteristics are shown in @transfer and @output, respectively. 

/*
The transfer characteristics show the drain current as a function of the gate voltage, while the output characteristics show the drain current as a function of the drain voltage for different gate voltages. The transfer characteristics show the saturation region, the linear region, and the subthreshold region, while the output characteristics show the saturation region and the linear region. The transfer characteristics also show the threshold voltage, which is the gate voltage at which the drain current starts to increase significantly. 
The output characteristics show the drain current saturation at high drain voltages, which is due to the channel pinch-off effect. The transfer characteristics also show the subthreshold swing, which is the change in the gate voltage required to change the drain current by one decade in the subthreshold region. The subthreshold swing is an important parameter for low-power applications, as it determines the energy efficiency of the device. The transfer characteristics
